# HNSW Implementation Status

## Current Issue

The current HNSW implementation has encountered a fundamental architectural incompatibility with the HNSW.Net library API.

### Problem

HNSW.Net library:
- Uses `BuildGraph(IList<TItem> items, Random generator, Parameters parameters)` method
- Requires building the entire graph from a complete list of items at once
- Does not support incremental additions (`AddItem` method doesn't exist)
- Works with immutable graph structures

Our design requirement:
- Needs incremental addition of memories as they are created
- Requires real-time updates to the vector index
- Hybrid approach with SQLite for immediate storage and HNSW for search

### Current Status

The implementation attempted to use non-existent methods:
- `_hnswGraph.AddItem()` - doesn't exist in HNSW.Net
- `_hnswGraph.Count` - is a method group, not a property
- Various other API mismatches

### Solutions

1. **Rebuild Approach**: Use HNSW.Net as designed - rebuild the entire graph periodically
2. **Alternative Library**: Use a different HNSW library that supports incremental updates
3. **Hybrid Fallback**: Use SQLite with vector similarity until enough items accumulate for HNSW rebuild

### Recommendation

For now, the implementation should:
1. Use VectorSqliteMemoryStorage for immediate vector operations
2. Periodically rebuild HNSW index when sufficient data accumulates (e.g., 1000+ vectors)
3. Fall back to SQLite vector search for real-time queries

This approach maintains the hybrid architecture while working within HNSW.Net's constraints.
